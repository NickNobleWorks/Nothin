Nothin
======

A bare bones WordPress boilerplate. Takes care of the setup, so you can jump right into building.

## Goals

## Getting Started

This is the first time setup:

1. open a terminal, and navigate to wherever you keep your projects
2. clone this repo
3. navigate to the new folder: `$ cd Nothin`
4. install dev dependencies: `$ npm install`  (requires [node.js]())
5. install required gems: `$ gem install compass autoprefixer-rails modular-scale`
6. symlink to your local wordpress install: `$ ln -s ../Nothin ~/path/to/wp-content/themes/Nothin`

## Developement workflow

1. run `$ grunt` from within the project folder
2. Build the most awesome theme in the world
3. ????
4. ~~Profit.~~ Give it away for free! (or not - we don't care!)
